    <p>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known
        as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He is a Professorial Fellow of Computer Science at the University of
        Oxford and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Berners-Lee proposed an information
        management system on 12 March 1989, then implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext
        Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November.</p>

    <p>Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of
        the Web. He co-founded (with his then wife-to-be Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. He is a senior
        researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
        Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) and a member of the advisory
        board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees
        of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute and is currently an advisor at
        social network MeWe.</p>

    <p>In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.</p>

    <p>He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and helped foster the Web's subsequent explosive
        development. He currently directs the W3 Consortium, developing tools and standards to further the Web's
        potential. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>

    <p>He was named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a
        number of other accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web" during the
        2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer. He tweeted
        "This is for everyone" which appeared in LED lights attached to the chairs of the audience. He received the 2016
        Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and
        algorithms allowing the Web to scale".</p>

    <h2>Early life and education</h2>

    <p>Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England, the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee Woods and
        Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike is a professor of ecology and climate change management. His parents were
        computer scientists who worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen
        Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south-west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at the
        time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975. A keen trainspotter as a
        child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway. He studied at The Queen's College,
        Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class Bachelor of Arts degree in physics. While at
        university, Berners-Lee made a computer out of an old television set, which he bought from a repair shop.
    </p>

    <h2>Career and research</h2>

    <p>After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole,
        Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for
        printers.</p>

    <p>Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed
        a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among
        researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.</p>

    <p>After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth,
        Dorset. He ran the company's technical side for three years. The project he worked on was a "real-time
        remote procedure call" which gave him experience in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a
        fellow.</p>

    <p>In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with
        the Internet: </p>

    <blockquote>I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide
        Web.
        <cite>—Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult
        when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the
        Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step
        of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there
        as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.
        <cite>—Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Policy work</h3>

    <p>In June 2009, then-British prime minister Gordon Brown announced that Berners-Lee would work with the UK
        government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of
        Information Task Force. Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt are the two key figures behind data.gov.uk,
        a UK government project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free reuse. Commenting on
        the opening up of Ordnance Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said: "The changes signal a wider cultural
        change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a
        good reason not to—not the other way around." He went on to say: "Greater openness, accountability and
        transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more
        directly involved in issues that matter to them."</p>

    <h2>Personal life</h2>

    <p>Berners-Lee has said "I like to keep work and personal life separate."</p>

    <p>Berners-Lee married Nancy Carlson, an American computer programmer, in 1990. She was also working in Switzerland
        at the World Health Organization. They had two children and divorced in 2011. In 2014, he married Rosemary
        Leith at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace in London. Leith is a Canadian Internet and banking
        entrepreneur and a founding director of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web Foundation. The couple also collaborate
        on venture capital to support artificial intelligence companies.</p>
