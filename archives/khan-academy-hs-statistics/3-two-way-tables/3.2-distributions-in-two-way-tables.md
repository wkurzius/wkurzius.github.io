This last section is all about marginal vs conditional distributions in two-way tables. Let's look at our table from last section to see where we can find these different distributions.

|           | Morning | Evening | Total   |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Coffee    | 45      | 15      | **60**  |
| Tea       | 10      | 42      | **52**  |
| **Total** | **55**  | **57**  | **112** |

First up is marginal distributions, which you can find on the margins (i.e. edges) of the table. These only look at the distribution of one variable. The marginal distribution of preferred drinks would be

|           | Morning | Evening | Total           |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Coffee    | 45      | 15      | **60**{: .red } |
| Tea       | 10      | 42      | **52**{: .red } |
| **Total** | **55**  | **57**  | **112**         |

The marginal distribution of preferred time to drink would be

|           | Morning         | Evening         | Total   |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Coffee    | 45              | 15              | **60**  |
| Tea       | 10              | 42              | **52**  |
| **Total** | **55**{: .red } | **57**{: .red } | **112** |

If you need percentages for either of these, divide each number by the total, so 112 in this case.

Conditional distributions on the other hand, involve both variables. The conditional distribution of preferred time to drink for coffee drinkers would be

|           | Morning       | Evening       | Total   |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Coffee    | *45*{: .red } | *15*{: .red } | **60**  |
| Tea       | 10            | 42            | **52**  |
| **Total** | **55**        | **57**        | **112** |

The conditional distribution of proffered drink for evening drinkers would be

|           | Morning | Evening       | Total   |
| --------- | ------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Coffee    | 45      | *15*{: .red } | **60**  |
| Tea       | 10      | *42*{: .red } | **52**  |
| **Total** | **55**  | **57**        | **112** |

And again, if you need percentages, divide by the the total. The catch here is to use the relevant total. For the first one, the total is 60. The second example's total was 57.
