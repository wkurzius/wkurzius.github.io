    <h2>Timeline of (Some) Notable Events in Feynman's Life</h2>
    <dl id="timeline">
      <dt>1918</dt>
      <dd>Born and raised in Queens, New York.</dd>
      <dt>1935</dt>
      <dd>After being rejected by Columbia because of their Jewish quota, he attended MIT to study physics (though he started with mathematics and then electrical engineering).</dd>
      <dt>1939</dt>
      <dd>Earned his bachelor's degree and began graduate school at Princeton. The first seminar he gave was attended by Albert Einstein.</dd>
      <dt>1941</dt>
      <dd>Began work on what would later become the Manhattan Project, the US-led project for developing nuclear weapons.</dd>
      <dt>1942</dt>
      <dd>Earned his PhD with his doctoral thesis titled <cite>The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics</cite>. A condition of his scholarship at Princeton was that he could not marry, but with that over he promplty married his longtime girlfriend, Arline Greenbaum, who was suffering from tuberculosis, an incurable disease at the time.</dd>
      <dt>1943</dt>
      <dd>Continued his work on the Manhattan Project at the newly established Los Alamos Laboratory. When not working, he occupied some of his time at the secure facility by breaking into combination safes, usually by using the safe’s default combination or finding it written on a paper somewhere else in the room. Arline stayed at a sanatorium in Albuqueque for treatment, with Feynman borrowing a car to make the 100-mile trip to stay with her on the weekends.</dd>
      <dt>1945</dt>
      <dd>Arline passes away with Feynman at her side. A month later, he was present for the Trinity nuclear test, the first detonation of a nuclear device. A few months after, he departed Los Alamos to teach at Cornell in Ithica, New York. While at Cornell, his work on quantum electrodynamics led to what are now know as Feynman diagrams, the Feynman propagator and the Feynman-Kac formula.</dd>
      <dt>1950</dt>
      <dd>Accepts a position at the California Institude of Technology (Caltech), but under the condition he can still take his planned sabbatical to Brazil. While in Brazil, he becomes enamoured with samba music and learns to play the <i class="foreign-word">frigideira</i>, a frying pan repurposed as a percussion instrument. He became profecient enough that he was invited to play in the pit orchestra in musicals.</dd>
      <dt>1952</dt>
      <dd>After returning from Brazil, he marries Mary Louise Bell whom he met while at Cornell.</dd>
      <dt>1954</dt>
      <dd>Awarded the Albert Einstein Award by the Atomic Energy Commission. A girlfriend of his would later walk off with the medal.</dd>
      <dt>1956</dt>
      <dd>Feynman and Mary Louise seperate.</dd>
      <dt>1958</dt>
      <dd>Attends the Atoms for Peace conference in Switzerland as a representative for the United States. While there he meets Gweneth Howarth.</dd>
      <dt>1960</dt>
      <dd>Marries Gweneth.</dd>
      <dt>1965</dt>
      <dd>Awarded the Nobel Prize along with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga for their work on quantum electrodynamics.</dd>
      <dt>1985</dt>
      <dd>Published his autobiography titled <cite>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</cite>.</dd>
      <dt>1988</dt>
      <dd>Feynman passes away with Gweneth by his side. His last words were "I'd hate to die twice. It's so boring."</dd>

      <p>I do not know—but I believe that Richard Feynman is either a Communist or very strongly pro-Communist—and as such is a very definite security risk. This man is, in my opinion, an extremely complex and dangerous person, a very dangerous person to have in a position of public trust ... In matters of intrigue Richard Feynman is, I believe immensely clever—indeed a genius—and he is, I further believe, completely ruthless, unhampered by morals, ethics, or religion—and will stop at absolutely nothing to achieve his ends.</p>
