Finding the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ means finding out the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$, or to put it another way, how $y$ changes as $x$ changes.

Well, what if there was intermediate between $y$ and $x$? We see this with composite functions. Let's look at a simple one: $y=3(2x)$. Here, we have an inner function $u=2x$, meaning our outer function can be rewritten as $y=3u$. So, in order to see how $y$ changes with respect to $x$, we first need to see how $y$ changes with respect to $u$.

OK, do $dy/du=3$. Whatever is going on with $u$, the rate of change of $y$ will be 3. And $u$ itself changes, with $du/dx=2$. So, no matter where we are on this function, $y$ changes by 3 for each increase in $u$, which in turn increases by 2 for each increase in $x$, meaning $dy/dx=6$.

Well, that should make sense because our composite function was really just $6x$, so the slope is going to be 6, no matter where we look. This is a very simple example with constant rates of change, but the concept applies to the more complicated derivatives.

For another example, for $y=(2x)^2$, let $u=2x$ and $y=u^2$. Now, $dy/du=2u$, so the rate of change will depend on the value of $u$, but it will be double it no matter what. Like earlier, $du/dx=2$, a constant rate of change of 2.

This time, we'll have to start with $x$ and work our way towards $y$. Let's say $x=3$. $du/dx$ is still 2, so that doesn't change. $dy/du=2u=2(2x)$, which in this case will be 12. So, when $x=3$, then $dy/dx=24$. For every 1 in $x$, $u$ is double that, and for every 1 in $u$, $y$ is twelve times that.

$$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}$$

This is the Chain Rule. To find the derivative of a composite function, find the derivative of your outer function with respect to the inner one, and multiply by the derivative of the inner function with respect to $x$.

And here is the alternate way of writing the definition of the Chain Rule.

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)] =  f'\left(g\left(x\right)\right)g'(x)$$

Like with earlier sections, the book has a slew of examples that you should look at. We'll cover some in class. The book also has rewritten version of your derivative rules that take into account the Chain Rule.

## Derivative of Natural Log

The proof of this, although it uses the Chain Rule, likely won't make much sense until we cover the next section. So, for now

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[\ln x] = \frac{1}{x}$$

or accounting for the Chain Rule

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[\ln u] = \frac{u'}{u}$$

Something to keep in mind is that $\ln$ is undefined for negative numbers, so you might run into $\ln\|u\|$ with the absolute value there as a safeguard. You can pretend the absolute value is not there when differentiating as the results are the same.

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[\ln |u|] = \frac{u'}{u}$$

## Bases Other Than $e$

$e^x$ is the inverse function of $\ln x$. So that means $e^{\ln x}=x$. Let's take that and apply it to an exponential function in another base, reason being is that we know the derivative of $e^x$ already.

$$4^x = e^{(\ln 4)x}$$

or more generally

$$a^x = e^{(\ln a)x}$$

With the Chain Rule, and keeping in mind that $\ln a$ is just a constant, we can find the derivative of $a^x$.

$$\frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = \frac{d}{dx}[e^{(\ln a)x}]=e^{(\ln a)x} \cdot \ln a = a^x \cdot \ln a $$

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = a^x \cdot \ln a $$

And we can do something similar to logarithms with other bases. The base change rule is

$$ \log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a} $$

where $c$ is whatever new base we want. Well, we want the base to be $e$ since we know that rule already.

$$\log_a x = \frac{\ln x}{\ln a} = \frac{1}{\ln a} \ln x$$

Remember that $1/\ln a$ is just a constant as we derive this one.

$$ \frac{d}{dx}[\log_a x] = \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{1}{\ln a} \ln x\right] = \frac{1}{(\ln a) x} $$

So, our two new rules, written with Chain rule in mind are

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dx}[a^u]      &= (a^u\ln a)u'  \\
\frac{d}{dx}[\log_a u] &= \frac{u'}{u\ln a}
\end{align*}$$
