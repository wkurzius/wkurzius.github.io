Despite the section's length, it doesn't cover anything that's really new. Instead, it combines the logarithm rule (below) with integration by substitution.

$$ \int \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \ln|x| + C $$

or the more useful version

$$ \int \frac{u'}{u} \, du= \ln|u| + C $$

There are a myriad of examples in the book, which aren't worth repeating here, so I won't.
