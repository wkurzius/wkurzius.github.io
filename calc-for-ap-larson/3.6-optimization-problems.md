## Applied Minimum and Maximum Problems

Unsurprisingly, now that we can find extrema on a function we'll do the same thing with applied problems. Given a situation, you'll be asked to create a mathematical model (i.e. an equation) and then determine the optimal point.

Aside from guidelines on how to go about solving optimization problems, there is nothing new in this section. You'll be exposed to a variety of different problems that will seem difficult to solve at first, but eventually you will pick up on the patterns and they will become easier.

As for those guidelines, here's the boiled down version:

1. Outline the problem
2. Develop an equation
3. Get the equation down to a single independent variable
4. Determine the domain
5. Use calculus to find the extrema
