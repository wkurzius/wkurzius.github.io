title: Email Management
---

I've seen some of your inboxes and they are quite â€¦ full. And I'm not just talking about unread, but *total* messages, which is the number in the top right of Gmail.

I happen to like email. It's one of the few universal communication protocols (i.e., not tied to a single company) and it's full of organizational features that allow you to manage the slew of things sent your way. But when left unattended, your inbox can balloon in size, rendering it near useless.

So, I'm going to go through some things I expect you to do because email isn't going anywhere. You will use it no matter where you end up after high school.

## Cleanup

If you've ever checked your mail on your phone, you might have noticed how long it takes to load. Well, the size of your inbox is what's affecting that load time. So, the first step is to clear it out. If you don't need or want it, delete it. Everything else should be either archived, or if it's something that you need to deal with, it can stay in your inbox. My inbox acts as one of my to-do lists. So as I finish things, I'll delete the associated email or archive it if I think I'll need to refer to it later.

## Unsubscribe

Now that you've got your inbox size down to a manageable number, you need to take care of all the garbage that gets sent your way. Best thing you can do is use the 'Unsubscribe' link at the bottom of most marketing/automated emails. If it's a reputable company, you shouldn't have any problems. If it's a shady email, best off marking it as junk or spam.

I bet a lot of your emails are from Canvas, but they have a link to manage your notifications instead of an unsubscribe option. How you deal with each option is up to you, but I suggest you at least turn off the emails that serve you no purpose. As a bonus, you can also manage them per course. That might help if there is a particular course spamming you on a daily basis.

## Maintain

Once you've cleaned it out and did a mass unsubscribe, things should be much better, but you need to maintain that. Make sure you delete or archive emails when you are finished with them. Anything sitting in your inbox should be considered a task you need to deal with. And don't get discouraged if it starts to pile up. I usually take a day each week to clean things out and make sure I addressed each email.

And of course, don't forget to unsubscribe to things as they come in. If you like getting some of those marketing emails, at least delete them after you've read them. Don't let them clog up the works.

## Spam

Everything above should be applied to your spam/junk folder, too. No spam filter is perfect, so important things might end up being caught by it. Be proactive about deleting spam and unsubscribing from the reputable emails. It should be a rare occasion that you get any spam, which will make it easier to notice when something ended up there by accident.
